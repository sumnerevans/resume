#work-experience(
  "Senior Implementation Tech Lead",
  "Can/Am Technologies",
  "Highlands Ranch, CO",
  datetime(year: 2025, month: 04, day: 01),
  datetime.today(),
)

- Managing and mentoring the team of developers responsible for building
  integrations with third-party vendors for Teller, a revenue centralisation
  platform for municipal governments.
- Collaborating with business analysts and project managers to improve
  requirements gathering and technical feasibility assessment processes across
  the Implementations team.
- Leading multiple efforts to make integration architecture more declarative
  and configuration-driven.

#work-experience(
  "Software Engineer",
  "Beeper",
  "Remote",
  datetime(year: 2021, month: 07, day: 01),
  datetime(year: 2025, month: 04, day: 01),
)

- Scaled our backend infrastructure from handling \<1,000 users to >100,000
  users by *sharding* traffic from high-volume bridges to a separate *Go*
  service called
  #link("https://github.com/sumnerevans/hungryserv-presentation")[_Hungryserv_]
  in a backwards-compatible, transparent manner. I created the initial proof of
  concept and then continued as a core member of the 3-member team that
  productionized the project over a four-month period.
- Reduced RAM usage for the
  #link("https://github.com/mautrix/telegramgo")[*Telegram*] to *Matrix* bridge
  by \~2TB (80%) by rewriting from Python to *Go*.
- *Reverse-engineered* and implemented features for
  #link("https://blog.beeper.com/p/introducing-beeper-mini-get-blue")[_Beeper Mini_]
  (iMessage on Android) including media, tapbacks, typing indicators, read
  receipts, edits, unsends, link previews, and chat metadata changes.
- Implemented the cryptographic key infrastructure necessary for message key
  backups and interactive device verification in
  #link("https://github.com/mautrix/go")[mautrix-go] by utilizing the standard
  Go *cryptography libraries*.
- Implemented media upload/download and interactive device verification in the
  Beeper client SDK written in *Go* which is being used in the next generation
  Beeper clients.
- Measured message send *latency and reliability* by instrumenting bridge
  *metrics*. Built a Dockerized *Go* service to process those metrics and send
  them to BigQuery.
- *Reverse-engineered* the LinkedIn Messaging API and implemented a
  #link("https://github.com/beeper/linkedin")[LinkedIn] to Matrix bridge in
  *Python*.
- Designed a framework for importing users' chat history, and implemented it in
  the
  #link("https://github.com/mautrix/whatsapp")[WhatsApp],
  #link("https://github.com/mautrix/facebook")[Facebook],
  #link("https://github.com/mautrix/instagram")[Instagram], and
  #link("https://github.com/mautrix/telegramgo")[Telegram] bridges.
